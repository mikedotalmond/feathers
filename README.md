Haxe externs for the Feathers UI framework - http://feathersui.com/

The library is definitely a work-in-progress and I expect there to be issues and missing implementations here and there.

I've included comments and metadata from the feathers source code where possible.

Feel free to report any problems :)

The feathers Haxe extern library can be found in lib/feathers
(it might end up on haxelib later)

To use it, you also need the starling library, a copy of which is included in lib/starling.

Note: Feathers requires a more recent version of Starling than the one currently on haxelib. 
I've updated the version in lib/starling with the latest changes and a rebuilt library swf.

The example project is a port of the feathers components explorer example - to test these externs..

I also ported the MetalWorksMobileTheme as part of this example - lib/MetalWorksMobileTheme
